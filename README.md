This is my first project I've done using Wordpress as CMS. I had to learn a little php basics, and of course something about Wordpress - it's file structure, and how It really works. I was a lot of fun for me =).

## What knowledge I've got will be most useful?

Scss! Yes! It was first project I was using him from beginning to the end, and really felt It is "CSS on steroids" - as many say.
I've cut my CSS to partials and it was like hit the nail on the head. It was much, much easier to organize CSS, easier to find what I was searching, when I wanted to change something.
Also mixins proved to be very usefull. I used them for example to center main container, or to add box-shadow. Now I think I could simply add this box-shadow inside the centering mixin, but...now It's a history ;).

## What next? Will I use Wordpress as CMS in my projects?

Rather not. The reason isn't that I don't like it, I want simply to write Back-End by my own using Node.js. Of course if I will meet Wordpress on my path in the future I will welcome him with spreaded arms.

## Last word - why I've done this?

My girlfriend is running something like temporary home for animals - especially cats. She will use it to publish cats which are searching new home and those who found it already.
For sure the project will be developed.
